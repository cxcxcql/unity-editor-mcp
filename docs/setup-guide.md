# Unity Editor MCP - Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Unity Editor MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 LTS or later
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Claude Desktop or MCP-compatible client

## Installation

### Step 1: Unity Package Setup

1. Copy the `unity-editor-mcp` folder into your Unity project's `Packages` directory
2. Open Unity and wait for it to compile
3. The package will automatically start a TCP server on port 6400 when available, or a free local port when another Unity instance already owns 6400

### Step 2: Node.js Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `mcp-server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

### Unity Configuration

The Unity package uses these default settings:
- TCP Port: 6400 when available, with automatic fallback to a free local port
- Host: localhost

Each running Unity Editor writes an internal runtime registry entry to `~/.unity-editor-mcp/instances`, so the Node MCP server can find the right project automatically.

### Node.js Configuration

The MCP server configuration is in `mcp-server/src/config.js`:

```javascript
export const config = {
  unity: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6400,
    reconnectDelay: 1000,
    maxReconnectDelay: 30000,
    commandTimeout: 5000
  },
  server: {
    name: 'unity-editor-mcp-server',
    version: '0.1.0'
  }
};
```

## Running the System

### Start Order

1. **Start Unity First**: Open your Unity project. The TCP server will start automatically.
2. **Start Node.js Server**: Run `npm start` in the `mcp-server` directory, or let your MCP client launch it
3. **Connect Your MCP Client**: Configure your client to connect to the Node.js server

When multiple Unity projects are open, pass `--project <path>` or set `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` if the MCP client cannot infer the Unity project from its current working directory. You do not set the generated registry file manually.

### Verifying Connection

When everything is connected properly, you'll see:

In Unity Console:
```
[Unity Editor MCP] Initializing...
[Unity Editor MCP] TCP listener started on port 6400
[Unity Editor MCP] Status changed to: Disconnected
[Unity Editor MCP] Client connected
[Unity Editor MCP] Status changed to: Connected
```

In Node.js Terminal:
```
[Unity Editor MCP] Starting Unity Editor MCP Server...
[Unity Editor MCP] Registering tools...
[Unity Editor MCP] MCP server started successfully
[Unity Editor MCP] Connecting to Unity at localhost:6400...
[Unity Editor MCP] Connected to Unity Editor
```

You can inspect discovery without starting a full MCP client session:

```bash
unity-editor-mcp doctor
unity-editor-mcp doctor --project /path/to/UnityProject
unity-editor-mcp doctor --workspace-id <workspace-id>
unity-editor-mcp doctor --instance <instance-id>
unity-editor-mcp doctor --json
```

When multiple Unity editors are open, discovery first honors explicit selectors (`--instance`, `--project`, then `--workspace-id`), then tries the Unity project and workspace ID inferred from the MCP server's current working directory. Git worktree workspace IDs are stored in Git's private worktree metadata, not in tracked project files. If Unity has a related worktree open but not the current one, discovery fails closed with `WORKTREE_MISMATCH` and shows the candidate instances.

## Testing the Connection

### Using the Ping Tool

The ping tool is available to test the connection:

1. In your MCP client, list available tools
2. You should see a `ping` tool with description "Test connection to Unity Editor"
3. Call the ping tool with an optional message:
   ```json
   {
     "tool": "ping",
     "arguments": {
       "message": "Hello Unity!"
     }
   }
   ```
4. You should receive a response like:
   ```
   Unity responded: pong (echo: Hello Unity!)
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Unity TCP Server Not Starting

- Check Unity Console for error messages
- Ensure no other application is using port 6400
- Try restarting Unity

### Node.js Cannot Connect to Unity

- Verify Unity is running and the TCP server is active
- Check firewall settings allow local TCP connections
- Look for connection errors in the Node.js console

### Connection Drops Frequently

The system includes automatic reconnection:
- Node.js will attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry delay is 30 seconds
- Check network stability and Unity performance

### Commands Timeout

- Default command timeout is 5 seconds
- Check if Unity is processing commands (not frozen)
- Look for errors in Unity Console

## Development Setup

### Running Tests

Unity Tests:
1. Open Unity Test Runner (Window > General > Test Runner)
2. Select "EditMode" tests
3. Run all tests in the UnityEditorMCP assembly

Node.js Tests:
```bash
cd mcp-server
npm test
```

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logs by setting the log level:
```javascript
// In mcp-server/src/config.js
logLevel: 'debug'  // Change from 'info' to 'debug'
```

## Architecture Overview

┌─────────────────┐     TCP      ┌──────────────────┐     MCP      ┌─────────────┐

└─────────────────┘               └──────────────────┘               └─────────────┘
```

1. Unity runs a TCP server that accepts JSON commands
2. Node.js server connects to Unity and exposes MCP tools
3. MCP clients can call tools to interact with Unity
